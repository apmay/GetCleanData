## Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repo contains the work for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data.

The R script "run_analysis.R" does the following:

1. Loads and merges files of training and test data to create a single data set.
2. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the set.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Writes the tidy data set to a text file "tidy.txt".

The Code Book contains additional information about the variables, data collection, and transformations used in creating the tidy data set.
